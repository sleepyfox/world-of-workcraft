# Easy guide to gearing for raiding

## Item Level of Dungeon Loot

The item level of loot has been increased by +26 in Patch 9.1's Season 2.

    Normal (level 60) dungeons will reward Item Level 184 gear
    Heroic dungeons will reward Item Level 197 gear 
    Mythic0 dungeons will reward Item Level 210 gear 
    Castle Nathria LFR – 187/194 (from the last 2 bosses)
    Castle Nathria normal – 200/207
    Castle Nathria heroic – 213/220
    Sanctum of Domination LFR - 213/220
    Sanctum of Domination normal - 226/233
    Tazavesh (megadungeon) 226
    Tazavesh (hard-mode) 233
    Sanctum of Domination heroic - 239/246

This makes gearing for raiding much easier, as:

* Normal level 60 dungeons require ilvl 144.
* Heroic dungeons require ilvl 170. 
* LFR (Looking for Raid) Castle Nathria needs ilvl 170. 
* LFR Sanctum of Domination requires ilvl 195.

This means that you can make (or buy from the Auction House) crafted items (ilvl 151) to help you get into normal dungeons, which will drop loot required to run heroic level 60 dungeons, which will get you into raids.

Crafts -> Normal -> Heroic -> Nathria/Mythic0 -> SoD/Tazavesh

Normal, Heroic and Mythic0 dungeons can be run as many times as you like. Raids and Mythic+ dungeons can only drop gear once per boss per week. 

The good news is, this actually makes things pretty simple. There are many other things going on post- reaching level 60, covenants, soul-binds, conduits, legendaries, runecarving etc etc etc ...
So just being able to ignore all this (at least in the beginning) makes the cognitive load on players much easier.
